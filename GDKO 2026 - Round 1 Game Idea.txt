You play as a god.

By changing your body's form, you have the ability to customize the world around you

Changing the whole planet, adding objects to the world, summoning stand-still allies, striking lightning, shooting out fire, etc.

The level will be one static level.

Each planet has one benefit and one cost.

Player forms, planets, abilities, and the benefit and cost (when on correlating planet):
- Lightning form = storm planet = summoning lightning = increase speed by 10% = lightning randomly spawns (chance to damage yourself)
- Fire form = burning planet = shooting out fire (towards mouse) = increase damage by 10% = health slowly decreases
- Material form = greenhouse planet =  spawning rocks = increase defense by 10% = decrease speed by 10%

Enemy types
- Shooter enemy = shoots bullets = low HP = low damage
- Sword fight enemy = fights with a sword = high HP = high damage
