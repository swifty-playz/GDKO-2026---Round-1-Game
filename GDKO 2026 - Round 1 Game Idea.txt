You play as a half-human and half-god.

You have the ability to customize the world around you.

Changing the whole planet, adding objects to the world, summoning stand-still allies, striking lightning, shooting out fire, etc.

The level will be one static level.

Each planet has one benefit and one cost (ex: you're 10% faster, but lightning randomly spawns)
